A fan-made web adaptation of [Secret Hitler](https://secrethitler.com), a social deduction board game for up to 10 players by Goat, Wolf & Cabbage. You can play it with friends at [secret-hitler.online](https://secret-hitler.online)!

### The Game
In the game, players are divided into Liberals, Fascists, and one secret Hitler. The Liberals must work together (or not) to discover the secret Hitler hiding in their midst, all while the Fascists try to elevate the secret Hitler to power. Pass policies to achieve victory and unlock presidential powers to investigate your friends. 

Can you find and stop the Secret Hitler?

### How to Play:

## About this project
### Technical Details
The Java server is divided into the [game simulation](src/main/java/game) and the [REST API](src/main/java/server). Communication between the server and client is done via websocket and HTTP requests, using the [Javalin library](https://javalin.io/).

The [webpage](/secret-hitler-online-interface) is written in [React](https://reactjs.org/), and features animations created with CSS. Assets were either adapted from the original board game or created using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).

- Art assets from the game (the boards, policies, identity cards, etc.) were adapted for the website with some minor modifications.
- Custom assets (made in Inkscape) were added based on the style of the original, most notably for the election tracker, policy reveal popup windows, and the player icons and tiles.
- All of the base game's rules were kept as-is, but the web interface, animations, and server are new additions.
